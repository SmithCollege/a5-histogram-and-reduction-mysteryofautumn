1. What went well with this assignment?
The histogram part went very smoothly, and the result was received as expected

2. What was difficult?
Figuring out how the function works while the block_size is not a multiple of 2

3. How would you approach it differently?
I would ignore the fact that the function doesn't work while block_size = 10 and stop banging my head on the wall for this problem.

4. Anything else you want me to know?
